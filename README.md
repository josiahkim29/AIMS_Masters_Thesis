# AIMS Masters Thesis

This is the GitHub respository for my Masters Thesis in partial fulfilment for the award of MSc. Mathematical Sciences(AI for Sciences) from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences(AIMS)-South Africa, accredited by Stellenbosch University.

Title:

Abstract:

Recently, AI Weather Prediction (AIWP) models have outperformed classical Numerical Models in a host of different weather prediction benchmarking criteria. Some teams developing these models have publicly released their model weights, enabling anyone to generate state-of-the-art global forecasts in a matter of seconds on a standard laptop. This research study aims to train a separate traditional machine learning model on top of these publicly available model weights (known as "stacking" in the field of ML) for each weather variable of interest and grid cell over South Africa, with the aim of beating any individual AI model.
